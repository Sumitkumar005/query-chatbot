Challenge Overview The Objective of this hackathon is to build an intelligent agent system capable of 
revolutionizing how supply chain professionals interact with their information ecosystem. The system 
must seamlessly integrate multiple capabilities to p rovide a unified interface for complex business 
queries. • Document Processing: The agent must extract key insights from internal documents like 
policies, procedures, and reports, understanding structure and context. • Database Interaction: It 
should trans late natural language into optimized SQL queries, understanding table relationships and 
schema. • Access Control *: To ensure enterprise -grade security, the system must enforce role -based 
permissions, maintain audit trails, and manage access to sensitive i nformation without disrupting 
user experience. • External Knowledge Integration *: The system should enhance internal insights by 
intelligently incorporating relevant and trustworthy external information using web, while ensuring 
consistency with internal policies. * Access Control and External Knowledge Integration would be 
nice to have but are not necessary. 4. Technical Requirements The application you develop should 
function as a sophisticated intelligent assistant that to access information. The system  should 
encompass: 4.1 Functional Requirements • Natural Language Understanding: Your application should 
be able to comprehend questions, including those with unclear requests and specialized terminology. 
• Intent Determination: Accurately identify the typ e of request, whether it involves document based 
knowledge, data analysis, or both. • Information Retrieval: Find and pull relevant information from 
documents or databases, recognizing and combining information from multiple sources. 4 AI Agent 
Hackathon •  Governance Enforcement: Ensure users access the correct information by applying 
access -control frameworks and clearly explaining any restrictions. • Insight Generation: Turn raw 
data into useful insights through contextual analysis, identifying trends, an d comparing information. 
Graphical visualizations would be a nice -to have feature. • Memory: The application should support 
short -term memory for subsequent questions in a chat, allowing it to remember context and provide 
coherent answers. Having long -term  memory for retaining user preferences and interactions would be a nice -to-have feature. 4.2 Non -Functional Requirements • Performance: The application should 
provide real -time responses with minimal latency and optimized token usage, ensuring a smooth 
user experience. • Security: Robust security measures should be i n place to protect sensitive and PII 
to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. • Usability: The user interface should be 
intuitive and user -friendly, making it easy for users to interact with the application and access the 
information they nee d. • Maintainability: It would be nice to have a system designed for easy 
maintenance and updates, allowing for the addition of new features and improvements over time. 
4.3 Technology Stack We encourage all participants to freely explore and choose their p referred tech 
stack. Your submission will be evaluated on creativity, innovation, and the effectiveness of your 
solution, not the specific tools you use. Below are some commonly used technologies across 
different components of the application. You’re welco me to go beyond these suggestions: API: 
FastAPI^, NextJS, Flask, Fastify, Hono, Express.js Frontend: NextJS^, VueJS, React Database: 
Postgres^, MySQL, Oracle AI/Agent Frameworks: Langchain^, AI SDK^, LlamaIndex Large Language 
Models (LLM): GPT 4.1^, Claude  3.5 Sonnet^, Claude 3.7 Sonnet^, Llama 3.1 Embedding Models: 
Embed 4^, text -embedding -3-large 5 AI Agent Hackathon ^ These tools/models are either 
recommended or have special support (e.g., credits or access) for this hackathon. All participants will 
rece ive API credits and access to OpenAI's GPT -4o for use during the hackathon. You're also welcome 
to use other models and providers — including open -source or hosted solutions — as long as your 
application meets the requirements. More details on model access  will be shared during the kick -off 
call. 5. Business Scenarios This section illustrates real -world questions that users might ask the AI -
powered application during supply chain operations. Each scenario demonstrates how the system 
should behave when handl ing queries involving documents, databases, or a mix of both —while also 
respecting organizational policies like access control. These examples are designed to help 
participants understand the range of use cases, system expectations, and how business logic can be 
operationalized through intelligent agents. 5.1 Document -Based Query User Query: “What is our 
company policy on inventory write -offs?” The system should interpret that the user needs 
information from internal policy documents. It must: - Locate rele vant policy documents. - Extract 
the section covering inventory write -offs. - Summarize the answer with references to the original 
content. - Optionally, provide more detailed excerpts if the user asks. 5.2 Data -Based Query User 
Query: "How much inventory do we currently have in the Southwest region?" The system should: - 
Understand that this requires live data retrieval. - Generate the correct SQL query to fetch inventory 
filtered by region. - Run the query and return results in plain, human -readable form.  6 AI Agent 
Hackathon - Provide contextual information such as total units or percentage of total inventory. 5.3 
Hybrid Query User Query: "Which inventory items qualify as no -movers according to our policy, and 
how many do we currently have?" This query in volves both documents and data. The system should: 
- Retrieve the definition of "no -mover" inventory from policy documents. - Extract conditions (e.g., 
"no stock movement in 180 days"). - Generate a SQL query using those conditions. - Run the query 
and rep ort how many items qualify, along with an explanation of the criteria used. 5.4 Permission -
Restricted Query User Query: "Show me the profit margins for all products in Q1." This query 
accesses sensitive financial data. The system should: 7 AI Agent Hackath on - Check if the user has 
permission to view financial metrics. - If access is granted, proceed with the SQL query and return 
results. - If not, inform the user that access is restricted and suggest alternative queries. - Log the 
access request for auditi ng purposes. 6. Governance & Access Control While not mandatory, 
implementing governance and access control mechanisms demonstrates a strong understanding of 
enterprise -grade AI systems and significantly enhances your solution's credibility. In real -world 
enterprise systems, sensitive information must be protected based on who the user is, what their 
role is, and where they are authorized to operate. Participants are encouraged to simulate or 
implement mechanisms that respect both geographic boundaries and functional roles. 6.1 Geographic Access Control Users should only access data relevant to the countries or regions they 
are authorized for. For example: • A user assigned to India should only be able to view Indian supply 
chain data. • A Global Operations Manager can view data across all countries and regions. 8 AI Agent 
Hackathon 6.2 Role -Based Access Control (RBAC) Access should also be filtered based on 
organizational roles: A user in the Planning department can access inventory, logistics, and 
forecasting data. A user in Fin ance can access margin reports, cost breakdowns, and P&L data. Cross -
role access should be explicitly authorized, not implicit. Implementation Tip: Maintain a user 
metadata profile with role and region. Apply filters queries or document retrieval logic bas ed on this 
metadata. You can simulate this with a basic config or through API tokens. 7. Dataset We have two 
distinct types of datasets that must be integrated in your intelligent agent solution: • Structured 
Database: A relational database containing supp ly chain transaction data with interconnected tables 
showing orders, customers, products, and related information. • Document Repository: A collection 
of policy documents, guidelines, and procedures that contain qualitative information about how 
supply cha in operations should be conducted. These documents establish the rules, definitions, and 
processes that govern business decisions. Your intelligent agent solution must be capable of working 
with both data types - extracting insights from structured databas e tables as well as unstructured 
policy documents - and intelligently combining information from both sources when necessary to 
provide complete answers to business questions. 7.1 Supply Chain Database The database consists of 
roughly 180,000 transactions from supply chains used by DataCo Global over a 3 -year period. This 
dataset represents a comprehensive view of supply chain operations across multiple dimensions.
